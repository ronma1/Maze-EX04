# Maze-EX04
Android VR application made using Unity3d for Software Structure course assignment.<br/> 

## What's in the box? 
Unity3d project, written using C# and Java (Library integration).<br/>
The project includes a VR maze game and Java library for SPP (Serieal port profile) Bluetooth serial data reading.<br/>

### Why using bluetooth serial data while you can just buy a controller? <br/>
Our solution concentrates on bringing a real feeling of Virtual reality without using a controller. <br/> 
We use a small sensor on the top of the glasses in order to determine the user's position. <br/>
